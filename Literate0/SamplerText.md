
# Text Sampler
With a one line OneLiner? or Elaboration?

And then some real elaboration.

## [Section Two]

Actually testing dash without one liner following
## second case - now listed first
_ LongOneLiner - yes, this class has a multiline one liner that goes on and on
not really adding much information

And then a short elaboration, begining here
NOTICE: No parenthetical, so the second line of text stays with the one liner.

- firstAttribute - and then an att with a multi line oneliner
    with the data type at the end of the whole thing (MyData MyType)
    Here again, the elaboration starts after the second line, since
    the parenthetical closes the one liner.
- secondAttribute - If there's no parenthetical, you need a blank line before the elaboration..
    Here there's not blank line, so this gets to be part of th one liner

- thirdAttrhbute - A blank line ends the one liner, even without a parenthetical

    So the elaboration begins here


## Text handling
_ MyClass - with one liner and data type (Compound String)
And an elaboration with three paragraphs.  

NOTICE.  The parenthetical at the end of the header closes 
the text block for the one liner. So the rest of the paras
go to the elaboration.

Second paragraph. Second paragraph. Second paragraph. Second paragraph. Second paragraph. Second paragraph. 
Second paragraph. Second paragraph. Second paragraph. Second paragraph. Second paragraph. 
Second paragraph. Second paragraph. Second paragraph. 

Third paragraph
