# Literate Tester

This is a small sample of a Literate Data Model, used for testing each of the constructs, at lease once.  
## Sample Classes - with a one liner for the subject, spanning
two lines

And an elaboration, with a few paragraphs

Paragraph 2


Paragraph 3


### Editions
Class Edition - a manifestation of a literary work
basedOn: Literary Work, Other Base
- Title - the title, as shown on the book's title page (Full Title)
	Default: the title of the Work of which this is an edition
	  Code: baseWork.title

## Next steps
### Clean up

* Name parsing
* value types
* Rendering code blocks. capture language
* Subtypings - exclusive, exhaustive
* Data types with reference/value and cardinality
* Optional on Attribute Section
### Complete

* Code types
* And data block
### Validation

* cycles
* references to classes, subtypings
* references to attributes
### Flesh out

* Subtypes, subtypings
* inverse attributes
* Overrides what
* explicit for data type value/reference

### Futures

* Diagrams
## Tests to include
### Headers

Notice that, here, asterisks are used for lists and embedded list, so the items won't be confused with attributes

* Subject - w/ one-liner
* Class one-liner?, Value Type
* Attribute Section - optional?	
* Attribute Header
**  with and without one-liners
** with and without data type expressions
* Formulas, derivation, default, constraint
* Annotations 

### Name tests
* Variations
	* Styling
	* Anchors
* In:
	* Headers
	* Class lists
	* subtyping lists
	* 

### Class clauses

* Plural
* Abbreviation
* Subtype of
* Based on
* Where
* Diagnostics
* Annotations

Fleshed in
* Subtypes, subtypings
* Dependents
* Ancestors
* 
### Attribute clauses

* Data type
* Default
* Derivation
* Constraint
* Required/optional - if/unless

Fleshed in
* overrides
* inverse of
### Constraints and derivations

## More Tests needed
### Formula Tester
* English
* OCL
* Message
* Severity

### Data types

* Base Type. Reference vs Value
* List, set, mapping types
* Nested operators

_ Literary Work
- first Edition - a home for the data type clauses (List of Edition)

	data type: Edition
	data type: Edition reference
	data type: Edition value
	data type: List of Edition
		testing with singular for of class name
	
	data type: List of Editions
		testing for plural form should be equivalent
	data type: List of set of Editions
	data type: List of sets of Editions
	
_ Edition - to try more complex data types
- author - assuming just one
	data type: Person
- artists - allowing for multiple
	data type: list of People
- contributors
	data type: mapping of Roles to Lists of Person values
	data type: mapping of Role to List of People

	constraint: Must be several for each role
	code: len(contributors[role]) > 1 for each role
	message: not enough contributors for role
	severity: Error
	con note: constraints take annotations which may span 
	multiple lines.

	And those annotations may have their own elaborations.
	Which may contain more that one paragraph.

	Here's a second paragraph, followed by a code block
	``` markdown
	This is the code block for  the annotation
	```

	

	default: {'author': [a, b, c] }
	def ote: defaults take annotations

	derivation: {'author': [a, b, c] }
	der note: derivations take annotations

### Data type clauses

* Optionality
* Cardinality
## Elaborations

### Lists, indented lists
### Code blocks with language
### Block quotes

### Pseudo admonitions

This is a :warning: Don't do that

> :warning: **Warning:** 
> Do not push the big red button.

> :memo: **Note:** Sunrises are beautiful.

> :bulb: **Tip:** Remember to appreciate the little things in life.

So, how do I insert an emoji?  üêõ
In Obsidian the colon, after a space? üõ∞

### Markdown code blocks?
```markdown
This is some text, with indented lists
- Item
- Item2
- Item 3
	- Item a 
	- Item b
	- Item c
```




### Code Tables - CSV Codeblock
So. This is the **one to use to enter codes**, lists of annotations, etc


```csv
Pos, Date, Name, Price
1, 2023-09-28, Spices, 150$
2, 2023-02-29, Shovel, 1.25$
```


### HTML code
<center>
This should be centered

### Comments

Here's a paragraph that will be visible.
(Hard to see what's required: blank lines?]

[This is a comment that will be hidden.]: # 


[This is a comment] #


[This is a comment that will be hidden.]: # 

And here's another paragraph that's visible.


### Figures
![[DSC00273 Copy.jpg]]

just copy and paste into Obsidian page (or drag and drop)

Captions are harder

## Diagrams
Just use Mermaid in code block
``` (mermaid)

block-beta
  columns 3
  a:3
  block:group1:2
    columns 2
    h i j k
  end
  g
  block:group2:3
    %% columns auto (default)
    l m n o p q r
  end
```

And here's the result
```mermaid

block-beta
  columns 3
  a:3
  block:group1:2
    columns 2
    h i j k
  end
  g
  block:group2:3
    %% columns auto (default)
    l m n o p q r
  end
```


## Admonitions
```ad-tip
title: This is a tip 
This is the content of the admonition tip. 
```
