## Response Protocol:
You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON in one of these two formats:

### Format 1: Changes Only
```json
{{
  "response_type": "changes",
  "changes": [
    {{
      "path": "subjects[0].classes[0].one_liner.content",
      "old_value": "previous value",
      "new_value": "improved value", 
      "reason": "explanation",
      "change_type": "improvement_type"
    }}
  ],
  "summary": "Brief description of changes made"
}}
```

### Format 2: Complete Updated Model
```json
{{
  "response_type": "full_model",
  "model": {{ ...complete LiterateModel JSON... }},
  "changes": [...array of changes as above...],
  "summary": "Brief description of changes made"
}}
```

## Key Guidelines:
- One-liners should be noun phrases, not sentences
- Add Python expressions for missing constraints/derivations
- Improve clarity and consistency
- Mark embellishments with is_embellishment: true
- Follow the LDM schema precisely
- Respond with ONLY the JSON object, no other text

The current model will be provided in each request. Make improvements based on the specific request while following LDM best practices.
